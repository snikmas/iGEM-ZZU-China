          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <h2>Problem Description</h2>
          <p>
            Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide (Figure 1), with over 2.3 million new cases annually. China accounts for as much as 18.4% (approximately 420,000 cases). Breast cancer ranks first in mortality among female cancers, with a global age-standardized mortality rate (ASR World) of 12.7 per 100,000 in 2022 (Figure 2), representing a major health burden. There is a significant gap between the incidence and mortality rates (46.8 vs. 12.7 per 100,000) (Figure 3), indicating that diagnosis is key to improving survival. However, current technologies face significant bottlenecks: traditional imaging (e.g., mammography) has insufficient sensitivity for dense breast tissue and is prone to missed diagnoses; tissue biopsy carries invasive risks and has limited accessibility at the primary care level; and liquid biopsy (e.g., ctDNA) still has blind spots in early detection and key molecular subtyping (such as HER2/ER/PR). Exosomes, which carry breast cancer-specific markers (e.g., HER2, CA15-3) as messengers of the tumor microenvironment, show significantly elevated concentrations in the blood of stage I patients, making them ideal targets for early, non-invasive diagnosis. However, there is an urgent clinical need for tools that can perform <strong>on-site, rapid (&lt;1 hour), and highly specific (&gt;95%)</strong> multiplex detection, in order to address the issue of screening coverage being below 40% among high-risk populations.

          <h1>Commercial Prospects</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Breast cancer (BC)</strong> is the most common malignant tumor among women (WHO 2024), with incidence increasing significantly with age and showing marked regional variation. In China, only 40% of newly diagnosed patients are in the early stages (stage I–II), while more than 60% are already at advanced stages (stage III–IV) at the time of diagnosis, resulting in the loss of curative treatment opportunities and a sharp decline in the 5-year survival rate to below 50%. Breast cancer poses a serious threat to women’s health, consistently ranking as the most prevalent malignant tumor among Chinese women. With the acceleration of population aging and increasing awareness of screening, the annual incidence of breast cancer in China continues to rise at a rate of 3–4%. Notably, the proportion of Chinese patients diagnosed at an advanced stage (35–40%) is significantly higher than in developed countries (e.g., &lt;20% in the U.S.). Due to the lack of typical symptoms in early-stage breast cancer, clinical diagnosis relies heavily on imaging-based screening (such as mammography and ultrasound) and tissue biopsy. However, limited access to equipment, high testing costs, and invasive risks have resulted in over 50% of high-risk populations being unable to receive regular screening, thereby missing the optimal treatment window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team has developed the <strong>EXOCRISPR Breast Cancer Exosome Detection Kit</strong> in response to the high incidence of breast cancer among Chinese women, lagging early screening capabilities, and the reliance of traditional diagnostic methods on expensive and difficult-to-deploy equipment. This product integrates CRISPR aptamer-based recognition with quad-channel rapid test card technology to offer a non-invasive, fast, and low-cost home-based early screening solution for breast cancer. It effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as complex procedures, long turnaround times, and poor privacy.

          <h1>Intellectual Property</h1>
          <p>
            Although some basic biological materials in our detection platform (such as breast cancer exosome markers ERBB2 and EPCAM) are naturally occurring and therefore not patentable by themselves, our innovative aptamer construction methods and integrated detection structures provide multiple viable avenues for intellectual property protection, which are the cornerstone of successful product commercialization.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our key components is the high-affinity aptamers (e.g., ERBB2-APT, EPCAM-APT) screened by SELEX technology and optimized at specific sites, specifically designed to recognize particular markers in breast cancer exosomes. While the basic sequences may be sourced from public databases, our structurally re-engineered and affinity-screened sequences exhibit differentiated binding efficiency and specificity, providing a foundation for applying for use patents on their functional combinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team has also developed a visual detection platform integrating a CRISPR-Cas14a-driven signal amplification module with a four-channel colloidal gold lateral flow card structure, capable of detecting multiple breast cancer markers within 30 minutes without any instruments. In this design, the optimized positions of the signal transduction module, sample release structure, and signal readout window, along with the chromatographic path combination, provide opportunities for device and process patent applications. Additionally, we are preparing to file patent applications to protect our coupling strategy between aptamers and CRISPR, which enables multiplex parallel amplification reactions to enhance signal comparison and interference suppression capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although some reaction components (such as Cas14a enzyme or breast cancer markers) are publicly known, our core innovations lie in their system integration, fine-tuning logic of the aptamer screening process, and the modular architecture of the four-channel detection card. These constitute the main content of our utility model and invention patent submissions to the National Intellectual Property Office.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, we are in the “patent application preparation” phase, with all experimental data and core technical details being organized. We expect to submit at least one formal patent application within the next 6–9 months. During this period, we adopt a confidentiality-first, disclosure-later strategy, and maintain version control of key materials and designs through an internal numbering system to ensure continuity and legal traceability of intellectual property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the formal acceptance of patent applications, multiple technical modules of our platform continue to enjoy priority protection under the “first disclosure principle,” ensuring our technological lead when facing potential competitors.

          <h1>Development Plan</h1>
          <p>
            Throughout the EXOCRISPR project development cycle, we recognize uncertainties in technology, funding, and market conditions at every stage. Therefore, we have formulated a phased and adaptable strategic roadmap covering the full cycle from technology proof-of-concept, prototype development, clinical validation, company registration to commercialization, along with risk management and resource allocation strategies for each key milestone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our short-term goal is to complete key technology verification and prototype iterations between 2024 and 2026. This phase focuses on the construction and screening of high-affinity aptamers, optimization of the quadruple rapid test card structure, standardization of integrated sample reaction processes, and visualization of signal amplification mechanisms. Through ongoing simulated clinical sample testing, we will obtain sufficient functional verification data to support subsequent registration and promotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period, the team participated in the 2025 International iGEM competition to conduct preliminary academic presentations and gather expert feedback. We plan to initiate company registration and intellectual property layout in the second half of 2025, including utility model and invention patent applications for key components such as aptamer construction methods, card structure design, and platform integration processes. We will also promote cooperation with university technology transfer platforms and incubators to establish EXOCRISPR as an independent legal entity.

            From 2026 to 2027, we will enter preclinical validation and small-scale trial production. Goals include completing performance evaluations with real clinical samples in partner hospitals, joint small-batch kit production with medical device manufacturers, and establishing production process standards and quality control systems for the test cards. We will also seek national or provincial “Innovative Medical Device Green Channel” recognition to expedite product registration and review.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 2027 and 2029, we will collaborate with third-party clinical research organizations (CROs) to conduct multi-center clinical validation studies. By partnering with tertiary hospitals and health check centers, we will verify EXOCRISPR’s applicability and stability across different usage environments, sample types, and patient backgrounds. During this time, we will expand investor contacts and plan to complete Series A financing, with funds primarily allocated to product registration, team expansion, and market access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon obtaining medical device registration certificates and marketing approval in 2029, EXOCRISPR will enter market introduction around 2030, supplying kits to hospitals, health examination institutions, and breast cancer screening units. Initial markets will focus on China’s first-tier cities and provinces with concentrated medical resources. Simultaneously, we will conduct academic promotions and clinical lectures in top domestic breast cancer departments to gradually build brand awareness and clinical trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 2031, EXOCRISPR will launch product line upgrades and scale industrialization. Leveraging the platform’s modular design, we will develop multi-target test cards for other tumors (e.g., lung cancer, ovarian cancer) and build an aptamer library capable of rapid switching between “cancer type + marker.” We plan to establish industrial demonstration centers in Central and South China and cooperate with manufacturers to achieve annual production capacity exceeding 500,000 kits, preparing for overseas market expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting in 2032, we aim to expand overseas markets and build a global distribution network, initially targeting Southeast Asia and the Middle East, pursuing CE certification and FDA registration, cooperating with overseas agents in WHO breast cancer screening initiatives, and integrating into grassroots public health systems via the Belt and Road medical aid mechanism to achieve global deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            EXOCRISPR’s long-term exit strategy will follow a dual-track model of “patent technology licensing + industrial cooperation.” On one hand, we plan to license the core aptamer recognition system, test card structure, and signal transduction mechanism to in vitro diagnostic companies with global sales networks for continuous royalty income; on the other hand, we will actively negotiate joint ventures or acquisitions with domestic or multinational medical device firms as effective channels for technology transfer and capital exit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this development roadmap, we are committed not only to building a molecular diagnostic platform with independent intellectual property, international competitiveness, and sustainable growth potential, but also to promoting early screening of major chronic diseases like breast cancer through “technology localization + affordable pricing,” reducing burdens on public health systems and providing earlier, more accurate, and reassuring detection solutions for patients worldwide.
